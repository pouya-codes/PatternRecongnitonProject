## Getting Started Guide

[This is the presentation file for this project.](http://bit.ly/2N7aWti)

This is my experiment to test SegCaps Net R3.
I overfit on a single image, then tested how the modeled performed as the image orientation was changed.

Pre-trained weights include in 'data/saved_models/segcapsr3/split-0_batch-1_shuff-1_aug-0_loss-mar_slic-1_sub--1_strid-1_lr-0.01_recon-20.0_model_20180723-235354.hdf5'

## Enhancements & Modifications

1. The program was modified to support python 3.6 on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10.
2. Support not only 3D computed tomography scan images but also 2D Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset images.
3. Change the dice loss function type from SÃ¸rensen to Jaccard coefficient for comparing the similarity
4. Add Kfold parameter for users to customize the cross validation task. K = 1 will force model to perform overfit.
5. Add retrain parameter to enable users to reload pre-trained weights and retrain the model.
6. Add initial learning rate for users to adjust.
7. Add steps per epoch for users to adjust.
8. Add number of patience for early stop of training to users.
9. Add 'bce_dice' loss function as binary cross entropy + soft dice coefficient.
10. Revise 'train', 'test', 'manip' flags from 0 or 1 to flags show up or not to indicate the behavior of main program.
11. Add new webcam integration program for video stream segmentation.
12. Accept any size of images and program automatically convert to 512 X 512 resolutions.


## Procedures

### 1. Download this repo to your own folder
  1-1. Download this repository via [https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/SegCaps/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/Cheng-Lin-Li/SegCaps/archive/master.zip)

  1-2. Extract the zip file into a folder.

  1-3. Change your current directory to project folder.

  ```bash
  cd ./SegCaps-master/SegCaps-master
  ```

### 2. Install Required Packages on Ubuntu / Windows
This code is written for Keras using the TensorFlow backend. 
The requirements.txt will install tensorflow CPU as default. You may need to adjust requirements.txt file according to your environment (CPU only or GPU for tensorflow installation). 

Please install all required packages before using programs.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### You may need to install additional library in Ubuntu version 17 or above version.
If you get the following error:
```text
ImportError: libjasper.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
These steps will resolve it:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libjasper-dev
```

### 3. Make your data directory.
Below commands:

  3-1. Create root folder name 'data' in the repo folder. All models, results, etc. are saved to this root directory.

  3-2. Create 'imgs' and 'masks' folders for image and mask files. 

  3-3. If you would like to leverage the data folder which come from this repo, then leave the repo as is.

```bash
mkdir data
chmod 755 data
cd ./data
mkdir imgs
mkdir masks
chmod 755 *
cd ..
```

### 4. Select Your dataset

#### 4-1. Test the result on original LUNA 16 dataset.
  1. Go to [LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 Grand-Challenges website](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/)
  2. Get an account by registration.
  3. Join the 'LUNA 16' challenge by click 'All Challenges' on the tab of top. Click the 'Join' and goto 'Download' section to get your data.
  4. copy your image files into BOTH ./data/imgs and ./data/masks folders.

#### 4-2. Test on Microsoftsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset 2017.
The repo include a crawler program to download your own class of images for training.
But you have to download the annotation file first.

 Click [Microsoft COCO 2017](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip) to download it.

There are two JSON files contain in the zip file. Extract them into a folder.

In this example, these two annotation files were extracted into the folder ~/SegCaps/annotations/

Example 1: Download 10 images and mask files with 'person' class from MS COCO validation dataset.

```bash
cd ./cococrawler
$python3 getcoco17.py --data_root_dir ../data --category person --annotation_file ./annotations/instances_val2017.json --number 10
```

Example 2: Download image IDs 22228, and 178040 with mask images for only person class from MS COCO 2017 training dataset.
```bash
cd ./cococrawler
$python3 getcoco17.py --data_root_dir ../data/coco --category person --annotation_file ./annotations/instances_train2017.json  --number 10 --id 22228 178040
```

You can choose multiple classes if you want. Just specify category of each class by space. 

Example: --category person dog cat


Try below command to list all parameters for the crawler program.

```bash
python3 getcoco17.py -h
```

```text
usage: getcoco17.py [-h] [--data_root_dir DATA_ROOT_DIR]
                    [--category CATEGORY [CATEGORY ...]]
                    [--annotation_file ANNOTATION_FILE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --data_root_dir DATA_ROOT_DIR
                        The root directory for your data.
  --category CATEGORY [CATEGORY ...]
                        MS COCO object categories list (--category person dog
                        cat). default value is person
  --annotation_file ANNOTATION_FILE
                        The annotation json file directory of MS COCO object
                        categories list. file name should be
                        instances_val2017.json

                        The resolution of images you want to transfer. It will
                        be a square image.Default is 0. resolution = 0 will
                        keep original image resolution
  --id ID [ID ...]      The id of images you want to download from MS COCO
                        dataset.Number of images is equal to the number of
                        ids. Masking will base on category.
  --number NUMBER       The total number of images you want to download.
```

#### 4-3. Test on your own dataset.
The program only tested on LUNA 16 and MS COCO2017 dataset. But it can support for your own dataset too.

##### 4-3-1. For 2D images

  Dimension of images: (Width, Height, Channels)

  - Channels = 1 or 3
  
  - Program parameters: --dataset mscoco17

##### 4-3-2. For 3D images

  Dimension of images: (Width, Height, Slices)

  - Slices = 1 (default) or integer (Number of slices to include for training/testing.)

  - Program parameters: --dataset luna16 --slices 1

##### 4-3-4. Mask files

  Due to the program only support binary image segmentation.

  The mask should be either 0(background, Black) or 1(Foreground, White) for each pixel.

  Dimension of images: (Width, Height, 1)


### 5. Train your model
#### 5-1 Main File

From the main file (`main.py`) you can train, test, and manipulate the segmentation capsules of various networks. Simply set the ```--train```, ```--test```, or ```--manip flags``` to turn these on respectively. The argument ```--data_root_dir``` is the only required argument and should be set to the directory containing your 'imgs' and 'masks' folders. There are many more arguments that can be set and these are all explained in the main.py file. 

Please be aware of manipulate function only support 3D images. This version of source codes *DO NOT* support 2D images.


The program will convert all image files into numpy format then store training/testing images into ./data/np_files and training (and testing) file lists under ./data/split_list folders. You need to remove these two folders every time if you want to replace your training image and mask files. The program will only read data from np_files folders.

#### 5-2 Train your model:

The program uses KFold cross-training and testing, and K = 4 as default. If your testing image files less than 4, please indicate the number of image files you have.

Example: You have only 2 images, and you indicate --Kfold 2, which means you will use 1 image file for training, and 1 image file for testing.

#### Example command: Train SegCaps R3 on MS COCO dataset without GPU support. Assume you have 4 or more images.

```bash
python3 ./main.py --train --initial_lr 0.1 --net segcapsr3 --loss dice --data_root_dir=data --which_gpus=-2 --gpus=0 --dataset mscoco17 
```

#### Example command: Train basic Capsule Net on MS COCO dataset with GPU support. Number of GPU = 1. K = 1 = You only train your model on one image for overfitting test.

```bash
python3 ./main.py --train --data_root_dir=data --net capsbasic --initial_lr 0.0001 --loglevel 2 --Kfold 1 --loss dice --dataset mscoco17 --recon_wei 20 --which_gpu -1 --gpus 1 --aug_data 0
```

#### 5-3 Test your model:

For testing you will also have to specify the number of Kfolds as above if you
have fewer than 4 images.

Again, the program will convert all image files into numpy format and store training/testing images into ./data/np_files and testing (and training) file lists under ./data/split_list folders. You need to remove these two folders every time if you want to replace your training image and mask files.  The program will only read data from np_files folders.

Example: You have only 2 images, and you indicate --Kfold 2, which means you will use 1 image file for training, and 1 image file for testing.

#### Example command: Test SegCaps R3 on MS COCO dataset without GPU support. Your pre-trained weight file store on ./data/saved_models/segcapsr3/split-0_batch-1_shuff-1_aug-1_loss-dice_slic-1_sub--1_strid-1_lr-0.01_recon-2.0_model_20180702-055808.hdf5

```bash
python3 ./main.py --test --Kfold 2 --net segcapsr3 --data_root_dir=data --loglevel 2 --which_gpus=-2 --gpus=0 --dataset mscoco17 --weights_path data/saved_models/segcapsr3/split-0_batch-1_shuff-1_aug-1_loss-dice_slic-1_sub--1_strid-1_lr-0.01_recon-2.0_model_20180702-055808.hdf5
```

#### 5-4 List all parameters:

Try below command to list all parameters for the main program.

```bash
python3 main.py -h
```

And the result will be:

#### 5-5 Test your model on video stream:

Please note the segcapsr3 model is too big to load into the memory of Raspberry Pi R2/R3.
This program can be only executed on your laptop/desktop with webcam.

The segmentation task on segcapsr3 will take 45~50 seconds in a laptop without GPU support. The capsbasic net will take around 20 seconds. Although the program support 'ESC' or 'q' key press to terminate, you may need to terminate the console to close the program due to the latency of model inference time.

Example: Run the model segcapsr3 with pre-trained weight file without GPU at ./data/saved_models/segcapsr3/split-0_batch-1_shuff-1_aug-0_loss-dice_slic-1_sub--1_strid-1_lr-0.0001_recon-20.0_model_20180705-092846.hdf5

```bash
python3 gen_mask.py --weights_path data/saved_models/segcapsr3/split-0_batch-1_shuff-1_aug-0_loss-dice_slic-1_sub--1_strid-1_lr-0.0001_recon-20.0_model_20180705-092846.hdf5 --which_gpus=-2 --gpus=0 --net segcapsr3
```

This is the test result based on the pre-trained weight files 'data/saved_models/segcapsr3/split-0_batch-1_shuff-1_aug-0_loss-dice_slic-1_sub--1_strid-1_lr-0.0001_recon-20.0_model_20180705-092846.hdf5' which I included in the github.

## Condensed Abstract
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown remarkable results over the last several years for a wide range of computer vision tasks. A new architecture recently introduced by [Sabour et al., referred to as a capsule networks with dynamic routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09829), has shown great initial results for digit recognition and small image classification. Our work expands the use of capsule networks to the task of object segmentation for the first time in the literature. We extend the idea of convolutional capsules with *locally-connected routing* and propose the concept of *deconvolutional capsules*. Further, we extend the masked reconstruction to reconstruct the positive input class. The proposed convolutional-deconvolutional capsule network, called **SegCaps**, shows strong results for the task of object segmentation with substantial decrease in parameter space. As an example application, we applied the proposed SegCaps to segment pathological lungs from low dose CT scans and compared its accuracy and efficiency with other U-Net-based architectures. SegCaps is able to handle large image sizes (512 x 512) as opposed to baseline capsules (typically less than 32 x 32). The proposed SegCaps reduced the number of parameters of U-Net architecture by **95.4%** while still providing a better segmentation accuracy.
