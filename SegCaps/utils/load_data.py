Capsules for Object Segmentation (SegCaps)
Original Paper by Rodney LaLonde and Ulas Bagci (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04241)

This file is used for loading training, validation, and testing data into the models.
It is specifically designed to handle 3D single-channel medical data.
Modifications will be needed to train/test on normal 3-channel images.

Enhancement:
    0. Porting to Python version 3.6
    1. Add image_resize2square to accept any size of images and change to 512 X 512 resolutions.
    2.

        We want to weight the the positive pixels by the ratio of negative to positive.
        Three scenarios:
            1. Equal classes. neg/pos ~ 1. Standard binary cross-entropy
            2. Many more negative examples. The network will learn to always output negative. In this way we want to
               increase the punishment for getting a positive wrong that way it will want to put positive more
            3. Many more positive examples. We weight the positive value less so that negatives have a chance.
